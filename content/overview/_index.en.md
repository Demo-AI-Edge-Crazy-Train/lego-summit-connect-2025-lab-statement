This presentation section covers:
- **Mission Objective**: Stop a runaway LEGO train using AI at the Edge
- **Architecture Overview**: Understanding the Edge Computing setup with Nvidia Jetson Orin
- **OpenShift Environment**: Your cloud infrastructure and access details
- **Lab Organization**: How the workshop is structured across different technologies

By the end of this section, you'll understand the complete ecosystem we're working with, from the physical LEGO train to the cloud-based AI training platform.
