# Presentation

Welcome to the "Mission AIpossible" lab! In this first section, you'll explore the context and architecture behind our Edge AI mission.

This presentation section covers:
- **Mission Objective**: Stop a runaway LEGO train using AI at the Edge
- **Architecture Overview**: See the Edge Computing setup powered by the NVIDIA Jetson Orin
- **OpenShift Environment**: Learn about your cloud infrastructure and access details
- **Lab Organization**: Understand how the workshop is structured across different technologies

By the end of this section, you'll understand the complete ecosystem we're working with, from the physical LEGO train to the cloud-based AI training platform.
