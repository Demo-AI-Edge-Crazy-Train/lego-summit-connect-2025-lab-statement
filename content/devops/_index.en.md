In this final DevOps section, you'll implement modern CI/CD and GitOps practices for multi-architecture deployments.

This section includes:
- **CI Pipelines** : Build multi-architecture container images using Tekton pipelines
  - Deploy pipelines for x86_64 and ARM64 architectures
  - Understand how to build for Edge devices (Nvidia Jetson Orin)
  - Work with container registries and multi-arch manifests
- **GitOps Deployment** : Deploy applications using GitOps methodologies
  - Use Helm charts for application packaging
  - Deploy the complete train ecosystem to OpenShift
  - Test the integrated solution end-to-end
- **CD Pipelines for the Edge** : Build bootc container images using Tekton pipelines
  - Build bootc images for the Jetson Orin device
  - Deploy the bootc image to the device
  - Manage edge devices through a fleet management solution

You'll experience the complete DevOps lifecycle from code to production deployment, understanding how modern Edge AI applications are built, tested, and deployed across different architectures.
