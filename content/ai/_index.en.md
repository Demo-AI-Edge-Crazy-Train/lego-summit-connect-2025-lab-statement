# Artificial Intelligence

In this section, you will explore the different stages of a modelâ€™s lifecycle with **Red Hat OpenShift AI**.

This section includes:
- **Connection** : Access the OpenShift AI dashboard and set up your environment
- **Environment Setup** : Set up projects, data connections, and pipeline servers
- **Workbench Creation** : Launch Jupyter notebooks environment with custom images
- **Model Training** : Build and execute data science pipelines with GPU acceleration
- **Model Serving** : Deploy your trained model as a REST API endpoint for inference

You'll work with traffic sign detection using computer vision, transfer learning, and deploy everything using MLOps best practices. By the end, you'll have a complete AI pipeline running from data preparation to model serving.
