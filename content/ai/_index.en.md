### Part 2

# Artificial Intelligence

In this section, you'll dive deep into the machine learning workflow using Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI).

This section includes:
- **Getting Connected** : Access OpenShift AI Dashboard and set up your environment
- **Creating Your Project** : Set up Data Science projects, data connections, and pipeline servers
- **Creating a Workbench** : Launch Jupyter notebooks environment with custom images
- **Retraining the Model** : Build and execute data science pipelines with GPU acceleration
- **Model Serving** : Deploy your trained model as a REST API endpoint for inference

You'll work with traffic sign detection using computer vision, transfer learning, and deploy everything using MLOps best practices. By the end, you'll have a complete AI pipeline running from data preparation to model serving.
