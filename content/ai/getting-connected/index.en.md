## Environment Information

For the purposes of this workshop, we have provisioned a single OpenShift cluster with OpenShift AI deployed on it.  
Each participant has a unique user account to perform their work.

## Connecting to the Environment

1. In a new window or tab, open the OpenShift AI dashboard URL: [https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.apps.{{< param openshift_domain >}}](https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.apps.{{< param openshift_domain >}}).
2. Enter your credentials. The screen should look like this:  
![02-01-login1](02-01-login1.png)  
3. Since the password is simple, your browser may display a warning:  
![02-01-login-scary](02-01-login-scary.png)  
You can ignore this message if it appears.  
After authentication, the display should look like this:  
![02-01-rhoai-front-page](02-01-rhoai-front-page.png)

If youâ€™ve made it this far, congratulations! You are now successfully logged in to the OpenShift AI dashboard.
