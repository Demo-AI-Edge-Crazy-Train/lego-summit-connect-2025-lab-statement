# Red Hat Summit Connect Paris 2025 - Mission AIpossible

Welcome to this workshop, where you will explore part of Red Hat’s offerings in Edge Computing and AI.

You will experiment with the following technologies:
* **NVIDIA Jetson Orin** – Edge AI hardware platform with GPU acceleration
* **Red Hat Device Edge** – RHEL version adapted for Edge Computing
* **MicroShift** – Kubernetes distribution for Edge environments
* **Red Hat OpenShift** – Container orchestration platform
* **Red Hat OpenShift AI** – AI platform on OpenShift
* **Jupyter Notebooks** – Interactive development environment for coding and data analysis
* **Elyra** – Visual tool for creating MLOps workflows
* **Kubeflow** – Orchestration of MLOps workflows on Kubernetes
* **OpenVINO** – AI inference framework for CPU and GPU
* **MinIO** – Object storage for ML artifacts and data
* **OpenShift DevSpaces** – Cloud-native development environment
* **Helm Charts** – Application packaging and deployment
* **Tekton** – CI/CD pipelines tool for building multi-architecture containers (x86_64 & ARM64)
* **GitOps** – Infrastructure and application management via Git
* **Kafka & MQTT** – Messaging and streaming for Edge communications

In this workshop, you will:
1. **Connect to OpenShift AI** and create a project with a Data Science development environment.
2. **Train an AI model** to detect traffic signs with GPU acceleration.
3. **Deploy MLOps pipelines** to automate model training and validation.
4. **Serve the trained model** as a REST API endpoint.
5. **Build CI/CD pipelines** to create multi-architecture container images.
6. **Deploy microservices** in a simulated Edge environment.
7. **Integrate AI at the Edge** with the cloud infrastructure to create a complete solution.

The mission: stop a runaway LEGO train using AI at the Edge!

We hope you have an excellent time!
