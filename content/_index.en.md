# Summit connect 2025 - Lab "Crazy Train"

Welcome, in this Lab where you will discover a part of the Red Hat offering related to Edge Computing and AI.

You will play with the following technologies: 

* **Red Hat OpenShift** - Container orchestration platform
* **Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI)** - AI/ML platform with data science projects and pipelines
* **Red Hat Device Edge** - RHEL variant for Edge Computing
* **Microshift** - Kubernetes distribution for Edge environments
* **Nvidia Jetson Orin** - Edge AI computing platform with GPU acceleration
* **Data Science Pipelines** - MLOps workflows using Elyra and Kubeflow
* **Model Serving** - OpenVINO Model Server for AI model deployment
* **Jupyter Notebooks** - Interactive development environment
* **OpenShift DevSpaces** - Cloud-native development environment
* **Tekton Pipelines** - CI/CD for multi-architecture container builds (x86_64 & ARM64)
* **Helm Charts** - Application packaging and deployment
* **GitOps** - Infrastructure and application management through Git
* **Kafka & MQTT** - Messaging and streaming for Edge communications
* **MinIO** - Object storage for ML artifacts and data

In this lab, you will:

1. **Connect to OpenShift AI** and create a Data Science project
2. **Train an AI model** to detect traffic signs using transfer learning with GPU acceleration
3. **Deploy MLOps pipelines** to automate model training and validation
4. **Serve the trained model** as a REST API endpoint
5. **Build CI/CD pipelines** for multi-architecture container images
6. **Deploy microservices** to an Edge environment simulation
7. **Integrate Edge AI** with cloud infrastructure for a complete solution

The mission: Stop a runaway LEGO train using AI-powered computer vision at the Edge!

Fun are expected ahead!
