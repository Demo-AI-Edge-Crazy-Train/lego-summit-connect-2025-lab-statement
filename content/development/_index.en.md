# Development

In this development section, you'll explore the microservices architecture powering our intelligent train system.

This section covers:
- **Introduction** : Understanding the distributed application architecture
- **Starting Services** : Launch the microservices ecosystem in OpenShift DevSpaces
- **Train Controller** : The central coordination service managing train operations
- **Intelligent Train** : AI-powered decision making at the Edge
- **Capture App** : Computer vision service for real-time image processing
- **Train CEQ App** : Queue management for train operations
- **Monitoring App** : Real-time monitoring and alerting system
- **Testing Services** : Validate the complete system integration

You'll work with a real microservices architecture deployed on OpenShift, understanding how Edge AI applications are built and integrated in production environments.
